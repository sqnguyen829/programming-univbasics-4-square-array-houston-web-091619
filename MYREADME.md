question : How come it didn't take new_numbers[count] = Math.squared(array[count])

                       but it took new_numbers[count] = array[count] * array[count]


#solution

def square_array(array)
  # your code here
  
  squared = []
  count = 0
  
  while count < array.size do
    squared << (array[count] ** 2)
    count = count + 1
  end
  
  squared
  
end
